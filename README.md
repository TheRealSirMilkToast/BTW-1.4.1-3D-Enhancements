# BTW-1.4.1-3D-Enhancements

Hello everyone! My friend Atheninja and I just got back into BTW recently and were super excited to see the release of the community edition! A more customizable, enjoyable BTW experience has drawn us back in, but before starting a new playthrough we decided to make a few addons to fit out playstyle a bit better. This addon is the first of the two: 3D Enhancements!

This addon is for version CE 1.4.1!!!!
I know that this version of the game is a bit out of date, but we have been putting in a lot of work on this addon as well as our other gameplay oriented addon on this version of the game so it is just going to be the version we are playing for the time being. Sorry for those who like to keep their versions up to date. If anyone wants to use any part of this mod for any reason feel free. Just please give us credit!

This addon is only required on the client side! No server mods needed!

# Changes
This addon aims to spice up the visuals of the game through the following changes:
1. Reworked the Infernal Enchanter model with textures to match:
   - Added the book model from the Enchantment Table
   - Replaced the candles with ones on the ground that rise when you get close, then get lit from fireballs that shoot out of the book
   - Changed the block to be the same height as the Enchantment Table
2. Added custom 3D models for several other blocks with textures to match:
   - Crafting Table (there is a config option to enable a crafting bench recipe)
   - Sugar Cane (and sugar cane roots)
   - Ladders
3. Allows custom textures to be used for the following textures, where they couldnâ€™t be used before
   - Lit candles (there is a config option to enable this)
   - Stoked Fire (there is a config option to enable this)
     - Custom stoked fire textures have not been provided, but the option has been tested with custom animated textures

All of the models in this addon were designed for use with a 32x32 texture pack, which is why only 32x textures are included. Textures that have been provided are a combination of John Smith Textures as well as some custom texturing work.
